# Certora AI Composer

**LLM-driven tooling for formal verification with the Certora Prover** — generating CVL specifications and verified implementations, explaining failed proofs, and closing the loop between Claude and the Prover.

AI Composer is a collection of Claude-powered agents and utilities, built by Certora Labs, that sit on top of the Certora Prover and the CVL specification language. Depending on what you're trying to do, it can:

- **Generate a Solidity implementation** that provably satisfies a given CVL spec and interface (the original "AI Composer" workflow).
- **Generate and verify CVL specs** for an *existing* Solidity project from a design document (the **AutoProve** pipeline).
- **Generate Foundry tests** for a contract.
- **Explain a failed Prover run** by extracting the counterexample (CEX) and asking Claude to diagnose the root cause and propose a fix.
- **Diagnose unsatisfiable rules** by analyzing the Prover's unsat core.

All of this is backed by a local, documentation-derived RAG index so the LLM can ground its CVL usage in the actual Prover manual rather than guessing.

> **New here? Go straight to [`GETTING_STARTED.md`](GETTING_STARTED.md)** — a single ordered, verifiable checklist covering both the lightweight CEX tool and the full install (AutoProve, AI Composer, Foundry generation, Sanity Analyzer), with a check after every step so nothing silently fails three steps later. The [Quick Start](#quick-start) and [Full Installation](#full-installation) sections below cover the same ground in narrative form.

## What's in this repo

| Tool | Entry point | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **AutoProve** | `tui-autoprove` / `console-autoprove` | Multi-agent pipeline that reads a Solidity project + design doc, derives properties, generates CVL rules, and iterates against the Prover until they verify. |
| **AI Composer (core)** | `composer.console.app` | The original workflow: given a CVL spec, an interface, and a system description, generates a Solidity implementation that satisfies the spec. |
| **NatSpec pipeline** | `tui-natspec` | Greenfield and update workflows for generating/refreshing NatSpec comments and CVL from source. |
| **Foundry generator** | `tui-foundry` / `console-foundry` | Generates Foundry test suites for a contract. |
| **CEX Analyzer** | `extract_and_analyze_cex.py`, `cex-analyzer` | Standalone tool: extracts counterexamples from Prover JSON output and asks Claude to explain the failure and suggest a fix. No Docker/DB setup required. |
| **Sanity Analyzer** | `sanity-analyzer` | Explains *unsatisfiable* rules by analyzing the Prover's unsat core. |
| **ap-trail** | `ap-trail` | Lists and inspects past AutoProve run "trails" stored in the audit database. |
| **cache-natspec** | `cache-natspec` | Browses the cache/memory namespaces produced by the NatSpec pipeline. |

If you only care about understanding why a rule failed, you want the **CEX Analyzer** — it's a single dependency-light script and is the fastest thing to get running. Everything else generates or verifies code and needs the fuller setup described below.

## Quick Start

This gets the standalone CEX (counterexample) tool running in a few minutes. It only needs Python and an Anthropic API key — no Docker, no databases, no Prover build.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- An Anthropic API key ([console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/account/keys))

### 1. Download the setup script

```bash
curl -o setup_certora_tools.sh \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xbrett8571/CertoraAIComposer/master/setup_certora_tools.sh
chmod +x setup_certora_tools.sh
```

### 2. Run it

```bash
./setup_certora_tools.sh
```

This creates an isolated virtual environment under `~/certora-tools`, installs `anthropic`/`python-dotenv`, copies `extract_and_analyze_cex.py` into it, prompts for your API key, and adds shell aliases (`cex-list`, `cex-extract`, `cex-analyze`, `certora-verify`).

### 3. Reload your shell and verify

```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # or ~/.zshrc
certora-verify
```

### 4. Use it against a Prover run

```bash
# See which rules passed/failed and which have a counterexample
cex-list ./prover_results

# Pretty-print the raw counterexample trace for one rule
cex-extract ./prover_results transfer_succeeds

# Ask Claude to diagnose the failure and propose a fix
cex-analyze ./prover_results transfer_succeeds \
  --spec ./spec/Token.spec \
  --output analysis.md
```

`cex-analyze` writes a structured Markdown report (scenario, root cause, ranked fix suggestions, confidence) to `--output`, or prints it to stdout if omitted.

For the full command reference, troubleshooting table, and a day-in-the-life workflow, see [`QUICK_REFERENCE.md`](QUICK_REFERENCE.md) and [`SETUP_GUIDE.md`](SETUP_GUIDE.md).

## Full Installation

The generation/verification tools (AutoProve, AI Composer, Foundry generation, Sanity Analyzer) need a local Prover build, a set of Postgres databases, and a RAG index built from the CVL documentation. This is heavier than the Quick Start above.

### Requirements

- Python **3.12+** and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Docker with Compose
- An Anthropic API key
- A local build of the [Certora Prover](https://github.com/Certora/CertoraProver), **or** a `CERTORAKEY` for cloud mode
- The Solidity compiler(s) your target project needs, on `$PATH` (see [Solidity compilers](#solidity-compilers))
- Access to Certora's private [`graphcore`](https://github.com/Certora/graphcore) repository (see below)

### 0. Clone with submodules

`graphcore` is a private Certora dependency vendored in as a **git submodule**, not a plain pip package — a plain `git clone` will leave it empty and `uv sync` will fail. Clone (or fix up an existing clone) with:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/0xbrett8571/CertoraAIComposer.git
# or, if you already cloned without --recurse-submodules:
git submodule update --init
```

You'll need SSH access to `Certora/graphcore` for this to succeed.

### 1. Provision the databases

From `scripts/`:

```bash
cd scripts/
docker compose create && docker compose start
```

This starts a `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` container pre-initialized (via `init-db.sql`) with the databases AI Composer uses: `rag_db` (CVL manual embeddings), `langgraph_store_db`, `langgraph_checkpoint_db` (workflow checkpointing/resume), `memory_tool_db`, and `audit_db` (run history). No attempt has been made to secure this database — treat it as local-dev-only. You'll need to restart the container whenever your host restarts (or adjust its restart policy).

### 2. Build the RAG index

The LLM grounds its CVL usage in the actual Prover documentation via a local RAG index built from the docs themselves:

```bash
./gen_docs.sh          # builds the CVL manual HTML into prover-docs/
./populate_rag.sh       # populates the rag schema (used by AutoProve, AI Composer, cex-analyzer)
./populate_extended_rag.sh   # populates the extended_rag schema (CVL + Prover docs, used by sanity-analyzer)
```

There is only one physical database, `rag_db` — `populate_rag.sh` and `populate_extended_rag.sh` both write into it,
as different PostgreSQL users (`rag_user` and `extended_rag_user`) each scoped via `search_path` to their own schema
(`rag` and `extended_rag` respectively — see `composer/scripts/init-db.sql`).

The RAG is fully derived from the docs and is read-only at query time, so when the docs change you just rebuild:

```bash
./refresh_rag.sh                 # regenerate docs, then wipe + rebuild the rag schema
./refresh_rag.sh --all           # also rebuild the extended_rag schema
./refresh_rag.sh --skip-gen-docs # rebuild from HTML already in prover-docs/
```

Run this offline — it empties the target schema before re-embedding, during which CVL manual search returns nothing.

### 3. Build the Prover

From the root of the Certora Prover repo:

```bash
./gradlew copy-assets
```

Then point `CERTORA` at the build output (`CertoraProver/target`). If you'd rather skip a local build entirely, AutoProve supports `--cloud` mode with a `CERTORAKEY` instead.

### 4. Install AI Composer's Python dependencies

```bash
uv sync --extra ml
```

If you're working in your own virtualenv rather than `uv`'s, also install the `certora-cli` requirements (`uv pip install -r certora_cli_requirements.txt` from the `CertoraProver/scripts` folder) and remember to activate that environment each time you run AI Composer. `certora-cli`, `certora-cli-beta`, and `certora-cli-beta-mirror` are mutually exclusive extras — pick exactly one at install time (`ai-composer[certora-cli]`, or the `prover` alias, for the stable channel).

### Solidity compilers

AI Composer expects `solc` on `$PATH` following the `solcX.Y` naming convention (`X.Y` from the version, e.g. `0.8.29` → `solc8.29`). The prompts currently default to targeting Solidity 0.8.29; adjust them if you need a different version.

---

## Usage

Each generation/verification tool has its own detailed doc; this section is a map, not the full reference.

### AutoProve — generate & verify CVL specs

Given a Solidity project, a contract, and a design document, AutoProve analyzes the system, formulates properties, generates CVL, and runs the Prover in a loop until the rules verify (or it needs your input).

```bash
tui-autoprove <project_root> <path/to/Contract.sol:ContractName> <design_doc>
# or, for CI/headless logging:
console-autoprove <project_root> <path/to/Contract.sol:ContractName> <design_doc>
```

Useful options include `--cloud` (run the Prover in Certora's cloud instead of locally), `--max-concurrent` (parallel agents for property extraction/CVL generation, default 4), `--cache-ns` (enable cross-run caching so repeated runs skip completed phases), and `--heavy-model`/`--lite-model`/`--tokens`/`--thinking-tokens` to tune the LLM calls (AutoProve has no single `--model` flag). Full details, including the five pipeline phases and cache/memory exploration, are in [`AUTOPROVE.md`](AUTOPROVE.md).

### AI Composer — generate code from a spec

The original workflow: given a CVL spec, an interface the implementation must satisfy, and a system description, AI Composer iterates with the LLM (proposing code, running the Prover, revising) until the spec verifies or it needs help via its human-in-the-loop tooling. It supports resuming a prior session from a checkpoint (each run has a thread ID and a sequence of checkpoint IDs it prints as it goes) so you can "time travel" back to an earlier decision, and a "meta-iteration" mode for refining a spec and re-running against a previous session's output.

This workflow is invoked through `composer.console.app`; see the module and [`TOOL_STATUS_AND_USAGE.md`](TOOL_STATUS_AND_USAGE.md) for current invocation details, and expect some rough edges — this part of the toolkit predates the AutoProve pipeline above and is being consolidated with it.

### Foundry test generation

```bash
tui-foundry <project_root> <path/to/Contract.sol:ContractName>
# or:
console-foundry <project_root> <path/to/Contract.sol:ContractName>
```

Generates a Foundry test suite for the given contract.

### CEX extraction & analysis

Covered in the [Quick Start](#quick-start) above. Once the full RAG/DB setup is in place, the packaged `cex-analyzer` command (backed by `analyzer/analysis.py`) gives the same functionality with RAG-grounded analysis; the standalone `extract_and_analyze_cex.py` script works without any of that setup.

### Sanity Analyzer — diagnosing unsat rules

When a rule comes back **unsat** rather than verified/violated, the Prover emits an unsat core showing which constraints conflict. Sanity Analyzer asks Claude to explain the conflict and suggest a fix:

```bash
sanity-analyzer /path/to/report/Reports/UnsatCoreTAC-myRule-myMethod-description-0.txt
```

It needs the extended RAG schema (populated by `populate_extended_rag.sh`, into the same `rag_db` — see the RAG index section under [installation](#full-installation) above) rather than a separate database. See [`sanity_analyzer/README.md`](sanity_analyzer/README.md) for the full CLI reference.

### Inspecting past runs

`ap-trail` lists and inspects prior AutoProve sessions recorded in the audit database; `cache-natspec` browses the cache/memory namespaces produced by the NatSpec pipeline; `scripts/traceDump.py` renders a full HTML visualization of a session's message history given its thread ID and the audit DB connection string.

## Examples

`examples/` contains sample inputs you can use to sanity-check your setup:

- **`examples/trivial`** — a minimal interface/spec/system-doc trio. The generated code isn't interesting, but it's the fastest way to confirm your AI Composer setup works end-to-end.
- **`examples/cccp_fixed`** / **`examples/cccp_buggy`** — a more realistic pool contract; the "buggy" variant has malformed rules and syntax errors on purpose, to demonstrate the tooling's behavior on imperfect inputs.

## Development

```bash
uv sync --group test --group ci
uv run pytest
uv run pyright
```

`uv sync --group test` pulls in `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, and `testcontainers`; `--group ci` adds `pyright`. See `tests/` for the existing suite, and `.github/workflows/` for the CI checks (lockfile consistency, submodule pin sync, `pyright`, `pytest`) that run on every PR.

---

## Known issues

- The original AI Composer workflow (spec → implementation) predates the AutoProve pipeline and its exact current invocation is in flux; check `composer/console/app.py` and [`TOOL_STATUS_AND_USAGE.md`](TOOL_STATUS_AND_USAGE.md) rather than relying solely on this README if something doesn't match.
- Two prompt-template gaps identified in [`CEX_AND_REQUIREMENTS_GUIDE.md`](CEX_AND_REQUIREMENTS_GUIDE.md) — a typo in `req_extraction_prompt.j2` and missing non-code-root-cause guidance in `cex_instructions.j2` — have been fixed as of this revision; see that guide's "Known gaps" section for anything still open.

## Project status

AI Composer is a **research prototype** released by Certora Labs. Code generated by AI Composer, and fixes suggested by the CEX/Sanity analyzers, should **not** be used in production without thorough independent review, testing, and auditing. The CEX Analysis tool is a standalone utility for extracting and explaining counterexamples from Certora Prover output; its suggested fixes are a starting point, not a substitute for verifying the fix actually holds.
